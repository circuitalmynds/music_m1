00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.200
To have become your prisoner, surely,

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.100
This summer will become even more perfect

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.880
Even though we can’t go back, I won’t forget it

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.880
Even though we can’t go back, I won’t forget it

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.060
Even though we can’t go back, I won’t forget it

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:20.640
But my feelings someday will be conveyed across

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.520
I will eventually be woken up from this dream right?

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.520
A blue shadow sways into a street corner

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.900
A blue shadow sways into a street corner

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:31.400
 

00:00:31.555 --> 00:00:32.555
 

00:00:33.395 --> 00:00:34.395
 

00:00:34.605 --> 00:00:35.605
 

00:00:37.555 --> 00:00:38.995
 

00:00:39.325 --> 00:00:40.325
 

00:00:43.065 --> 00:00:44.915
 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.200
 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.940
No matter how many years pass, I can’t say it

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.780
Even if I regret it, I won’t mind

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:55.920
Even if I regret it, I won’t mind

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.400
but till now, words will come out

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.220
hey, summertime

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.180
summmertime

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.500
I want to walk along the seafront street

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.440
Also, want to try and drive as well

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.060
Just a glance at you is enough

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.260
Hey, summertime

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.760
 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.120
Walk along the beach till dawn

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.140
Wanting to be wrapped up in the sound of the sea

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.380
Wanting to be wrapped up in the sound of the sea

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.440
Her gestures are really sweet

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.700
Her gestures are really sweet

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.200
 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.340
To have become your prisoner, surely,

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.400
This summer will become even more perfect

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.780
Even though we can’t go back, I won’t forget it

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:47.280
 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.780
 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:48.380
 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.060
But my feelings someday will be conveyed across

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.400
I will eventually be woken up from this dream right?

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.900
A blue shadow sways into a street corner

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.960
 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:04.460
 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.960
 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:05.460
 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.960
 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:06.460
 

00:02:06.685 --> 00:02:08.315
 

00:02:10.545 --> 00:02:13.215
 

00:02:13.565 --> 00:02:14.565
 

00:02:14.765 --> 00:02:17.125
 

00:02:18.115 --> 00:02:19.115
 

00:02:19.315 --> 00:02:20.315
 

00:02:28.835 --> 00:02:29.835
